	"Description": "This mod demonstrates how to add in additional factions beyond the original ones found in the game, it also demonstrates how to make a faction emergent.
	
This mod adds the unused White Huns and Moors factions to BI. The Moors start in Mauretania and the White Huns appear as an emergent faction

This mod is designed to work on BI only but the principle will work with all three games if you use the correct assets for that game.",
