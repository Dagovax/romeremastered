## Introduction

When making new unit cards we have provided the following blank alpha-channel png files to allow modders to match the look of the original game with a matching grass circle under the unit.

We have two files, the first has a slight offset and is what is used in the game, the second is centrally placed and could help people who are working on more unique units and would like an alternate positioning.
