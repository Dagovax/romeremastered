## Introduction

grass variations for the different climates, seasons, and ground types see [feral_descr_grass_textures.txt](/documentation/data_file_guides/feral_descr_grass_textures.md) for how sprites are mapped to textures.

valid climates types are:
* `test_climate`
* `sandy_desert`
* `rocky_desert`
* `temperate_grassland_fertile`
* `temperate_grassland_infertile`
* `temperate_forest_open`
* `temperate_forest_deep`
* `swamp`
* `highland`
* `alpine`
* `sub_arctic`
* `semi_arid`

valid seasons are:
* `summer`
* `winter`

valid ground types are:

* `grass_short`
* `grass_long`
* `sand`
* `rock`
* `forest_dense`
* `scrub_dense`
* `swamp`
* `mud`
* `mud_road`
* `stone_road`
* `water`
* `ice`
* `snow`
* `wood`
* `dirt`

Every ground_type has a scale, to indicate how big the grass should be. Use this to make "long grass" bigger without having to define a seperate sprite

`sprite <name of sprite from feral_descr_grass_textures.txt> <relative weighting>`

`Weighting` is the relative probability of this sprite being used instead of others for the same season, ground type, and climate.

**NOTES:**
* We have limited randomness to pick grass, so there's a limit to how different the weightings can be, on the order of ~1000->10000. There's currently ~1000 pieces of grass per 8x8m patch of grassy ground. So you can't have grass that's more rare than once every patch or 2. Also, patches are reused to reduce creation time and storage used, so lower probability grass wouldn't work anyway.
