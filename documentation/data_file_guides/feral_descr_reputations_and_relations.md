## Introduction

This is a new addition for Rome Remastered. This file allows you to:

* Modify pre-existing modifiers from original Rome
* Modify new modifiers added to Rome Remastered.

The additional modifiers for positive behaviours and the ability to disable penalties for actions like bribing rebels should allow players and modders to avoid having factions repuations being constantly too low or high and improve the overall balance of the game.

See comments in the file for further details.
